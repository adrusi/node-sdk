# Transloadit NodeJS SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk)

This is the official node.js SDK for Transloadit. It's been provided by the founders but everybody is encouraged to suggest ideas or code for improvement.

## Install

Inside your project, type

```bash
npm install --save transloadit
```

If there are no errors, you can start using the module.

## Use

```javascript
var TransloaditClient = require("transloadit");
var transloadit       = new TransloaditClient({
  authKey:    'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
  authSecret: 'YOUR_AUTH_SECRET'
});

transloadit.addFile('file1', filePath);
var assemblyOptions = {
  params: {
    template_id: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'
  }
};
transloadit.createAssembly(assemblyOptions, function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    throw new Error(err);
  } else {
    console.log('success');
  }

  var assemblyId = result.assembly_id;
  console.log(assemblyId);

  transloadit.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, function(err) {
    console.log('deleted');
  });
});
```

## API

These are the public methods on the `TransloaditClient` object and their descriptions.

### constructor([options])

Returns a new instance of the client. The `options` object must at least include `authKey` and `authSecret` keys (and their values).

You can also provide `service`, which defaults to `"api2.transloadit.com"`, and `region`, which defaults to `"us-east-1"`.

### TransloaditClient.addFile(name, path)

Registers the local file with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that file.

### TransloaditClient.addStream(stream)

Registers the provided stream with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that stream.

### TransloaditClient.createAssembly(options, cb)

Creates a new assembly on Transloadit, uploading all streams and files that were registered via `.addStream()` and `.addFile()` prior to the call to `.createAssembly()`.

You can provide some options:

* `params` - an object containing your `template_id`, `notify_url`, some steps that overwrite your Transloadit template and other params to control Transloadit behavior.
* `fields` - an object of form fields to add to the request, to make use of in the assembly via [assembly variables](https://transloadit.com/docs#assembly-variables).

### TransloaditClient.assemblyStatus(assemblyId, cb)

Retrieves the JSON status of the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId`.

### TransloaditClient.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, cb)

Removes the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId` from the memory of the Transloadit machines, ultimately cancelling it. This does not delete the assembly from the database - you can still access it on `https://transloadit.com/assemblies/[[assembly_id]]` in your Transloadit account. This also does not delete any files associated with the assembly from the Transloadit servers.

### TransloaditClient.replayAssembly(options, cb)

Replays the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`. The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

### TransloaditClient.replayAssemblyNotification(options, cb)

Replays the notification for the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`.  The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

We'd be happy to accept pull requests. If you plan on working on something big, please first drop us a line!

The SDK is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), but the JavaScript it generates is commited back into the repository so people can use this module without a CoffeeScript dependency. If you want to work on the source, please do so in `./src` and type: `make build` or `make test` (also builds first). Please don't edit generated JavaScript in `./lib`!

Releasing a new version to npmjs.org can be done via `make release-major` (or minor / patch, depending on the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) impact of your changes).

Check your sources for linting errors via `make lint`.
